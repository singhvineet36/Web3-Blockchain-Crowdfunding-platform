# Problem Statement
The problem statement for crowdfunding using blockchain can be broadly defined as the need for a decentralized, secure, and transparent crowdfunding platform. Traditional crowdfunding platforms are often centralized, which means that a third-party intermediary is needed to facilitate transactions and ensure trust between the parties involved. This centralized approach can lead to higher fees, longer processing times, and a lack of transparency for both investors and entrepreneurs.
